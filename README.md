we using precompiled blobs in this mofo

Here's the problem. These files are a mess. It's 
like a toddler throwing a tantrum. At some point,
someone at the FBI had this shit in an organized 
timeline. Then we switched administrations, or 
someone leaned on them, whatever. Point is, they're
basically organized  to prevent people from actually 
piecing together the many coherent narrative threads.
Or conspiracies. Because that is what occured. A 
conspiracy of pedophilic corporate elite more or less 
conducting business in the public eye while Jeff 
organized flights and passports for a victim.

Sorry, git editor is a bad choice to write a novel.
Anyway, i dunno what all security vulnerabilities 
that name entails but I need somewhere to back up

Like why is from and to both redacted? Are we 
protecting the Epstein lawyers? I just think
being able to browse we should get an explanation
on what black box is and means. If it's victim name?
Great. If it's grisly specifics in photographic form?
Absolutely must be. Just have a note that says what it
is
